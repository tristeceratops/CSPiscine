find a correct way to store the multiple values in file (stay at stric values, I do not want them inside my py files) and then to generate py values with them

need to rethink the folder structure, maybe with variables
also rethink again on how to use makefile, maybe adding more variable to makefiles or to use makefile to send variables to py generator of ressource
